## 2026-06-14 - Semantic Mobile Navigation
**Learning:** Transitioning from non-semantic `div` elements to semantic `<button>` tags for mobile menus requires explicit CSS resets (background: none, border: none, padding: 0) to maintain design consistency. Synchronizing `aria-expanded` and `aria-label` through a centralized JavaScript function ensures a predictable and accessible experience for assistive technology users.
**Action:** Always prefer semantic `<button type="button">` for interactive elements and use a helper function to manage multi-attribute ARIA state updates.

## 2026-06-15 - Fixed Headers and Keyboard Accessibility
**Learning:** Fixed headers can obscure content when navigating via anchor links or when using a keyboard to "Skip to content". Using `scroll-padding-top` on the `<html>` element is a clean CSS-only solution to ensure the target element is positioned below the header. Additionally, a "Skip to content" link must be the first focusable element to provide efficient navigation for keyboard-only users.
**Action:** Always check for fixed headers and implement `scroll-padding-top` alongside a functional "Skip to content" link.
